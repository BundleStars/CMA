Welcome to CMA, our shared workspace for storing and scaling product analytics work across the team. This repository is the single source of truth for:

1. Analytical methodologies (e.g. causal inference, retention analysis, funnel deep dives)

2. Reusable models (e.g. pLTV, attribution, segmentation)

3. Project-specific analysis code (e.g. feature experiments, marketing impact, onboarding diagnostics)
